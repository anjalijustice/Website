        <h1>How can I help?</h1>
        <p>I’ve been living on the road for over four years with experiences in two vans and a vintage boat. Whether you’re dreaming of hitting the road or need help with your current van, I’m here to guide you through the entire process from start to finish.<span class="hide-desktop" id="dots">...</span><span class="hide-desktop" id="more">
        <br>
        <br>
        I’ve tackled a range of van builds, from budget-friendly to luxurious, and I bring a unique set of skills to the table. With hands-on experience in cabinet building and a deep understanding of tiny home living, I can help you design a van that’s not only stylish but also durable and practical. My journey has taught me what works, what doesn’t, and how to make the most of small spaces.
        <br>
        <br>
        My consultations are all about providing practical, actionable advice tailored to your specific needs. Whether you’re looking for design ideas, solutions for issues in your van, recommendations for the best products, or general vanlife guidance, I’ll work with you to create a plan that fits your lifestyle and budget. I believe that getting insights from someone who’s been through it can make all the difference, and I’m here to empower you to take the leap or tackle your next project with confidence.
        <br>
        <br>
        Let’s make your vanlife dreams a reality! Book your 1:1 consultation to start your vanlife journey or refine your current setup. I look forward to helping you hit the road with confidence.
