        <h1>How can I help?</h1>
        <p>I'm a front-end developer who loves turning ideas into beautifully functional websites. With a degree in Computer Science from the University of Michigan and three years of experience as a front-end software development engineer at Amazon, I bring a wealth of knowledge and hands-on expertise to every project.<span class="hide-desktop" id="dots">...</span><span class="hide-desktop" id="more">
        <br>
        <br>
        My primary focus is on crafting intuitive, user-friendly websites using HTML and JavaScript. Whether you're looking to build a new static website from scratch or enhance an existing one, I specialize in designing solutions that not only look great but also offer a smooth and effective user experience.
        <br>
        <br>
        I believe that a website should be more than just a digital presence—it should be an extension of your brand, easy to navigate, and packed with the information your visitors need. My goal is to help you create a site that grows with your brand and serves your audience effectively.
        <br>
        <br>
        If you're interested in developing a new site or optimizing an existing one, I’d love to help you achieve your vision. Let’s work together to build a website that stands out and performs at its best!
        <br>
        <br>
        Feel free to explore my own website—built entirely by me—to see my work in action and to book a consultation. I look forward to the opportunity to collaborate with you!
