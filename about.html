                    <h3>Engineering and Design</h3>
                    <p>I am a senior studying computer science engineering at the University of Michigan with 
                        a special interest in front end web development and UX design. I have explored these 
                        interests through my courses at Michigan, independently studying different languages 
                        and methods of design, and creating my own websites and apps. What I love most about 
                        front end development and UX design is that I get to influence what the user sees and 
                        how they interact with a product. I am always trying to find ways to incorperate design 
                        and development into projects that I am passionate about..</p>

                    <h3>Aviation</h3>
                    <p>My desire to become a pilot was sparked after my freshman year of college, I applied for 
                        a job at an airport and fell in love with the community and the freedom of being an aviator. 
                        I am now a student at Kalitta Flight School and intend to earn all of my ratings until I 
                        am a certified airline pilot. Flight training has taught me to be diligent and pay attention 
                        to details, I have learned to be resourseful and think on my feet both in the air and on 
                        the ground. As someone who loves to travel and see the world from a different perspective, 
                        there is nothing I love more than being able to get into my Cessna and take to the skies.</p>

                    <h3>Personal</h3>
                    <p>As a full time student of both engineering and aviation finding free time can be difficult. 
                        But I always take any opportunity I can to have fun and enjoy time with friends. Some of my
                         favorite things to do are slackline, hike, run, and travel. I have been fortunate enough to 
                         find amazing people to share these experienes with who support me in whatever I do. I am 
                         also a musician- Having been classically trained in piano for 13 years and many other instruments 
                         throughout middle and high school, I love to get involved with music whenever possible in college.
                          As a member of Groove High Energy Percussion I am able to express myself through music, enjoy the 
                          company of some dope people, and have a ton of fun collaborating and creating great shows each semester. </p>
