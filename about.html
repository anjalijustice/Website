                    <h3>Engineering</h3>
                    <p>I am a graduate of the University of Michigan with a BSE in computer science engineering, in September 2020 I
                        will begin working at Amazon as a software development engineer in the Bay Area and I couldn't be more excited!
                        My focus is in front end development and design and I have devoted much of my independent study outside
                        of college classes to learning different languages and developing apps and websites.
                        What I love most about front end development and UX design is that I get to influence what the user sees and 
                        how they interact with a product. I am always trying to find ways to incorperate design 
                        and development into projects that I am passionate about.</p>

                    <h3>Aviation</h3>
                    <p>My desire to become a pilot was sparked after my freshman year of college, I applied for 
                        a job at an airport and fell in love with the community and the freedom of being an aviator. 
                        I am now a private pilot and intend to continue my training until I am a commercial pilot. 
                        Flight training has taught me to be diligent and pay attention to details, I have learned 
                        to be resourseful and think on my feet both in the air and on the ground. As someone who 
                        loves to travel and seeing the world from a different perspective, there is nothing I love 
                        more than being able to get into the cockpit take to the skies.</p>

                    <h3>Personal</h3>
                    <p>  When working a full time job from home it can be difficult to separate work from regular life,
                         but I always take any opportunity I can to have fun and enjoy time with friends. Some of my
                         favorite things to do are slackline, hike, and travel. I have been fortunate enough to 
                         find amazing people to share these experienes with who support me in whatever I do. I am 
                         also a musician- having been classically trained in piano for 13 years and many other instruments 
                         throughout middle and high school, I love to get involved with music whenever possible. Recently I
                         have been traveling with my dog Theo in a van that I built out after college, I have had so many
                         wonderful experiences from this chapter in my life and am always looking forward to the next one.</p>
