# Website
Its my personal website!

TODO:
1. Make margins larger on all pages - everything is a little too spread out
2. Fix sizing of project boxes on homepage
3. Change format of buttons (dont like rounded, change color too maybe)
4. Remove/change footer color 
5. Make links into icons for better usability (linkedin, email, github, resume)
6. Add whitespace in general. Lots of words on the page, too much to read
7. Increase font size and change font possibly
